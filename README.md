# EECS-341-Final-Project
Final project for EECS 341 - Introduction to Database Systems
My team was tasked with creating a simple database design with approximately 5-10 relations. We decided to create a database for a coffee shop which would store information about products, customers, sales, and vendors. We also wrote a simple HTML/PHP interface with Bootstrap to demonstrate the functionality.
