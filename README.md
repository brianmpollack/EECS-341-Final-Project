# EECS-341-Final-Project
Final project for EECS 341 - Introduction to Database Systems

My team was tasked with creating a simple database design with approximately 5-10 relations. We decided to create a database for a coffee shop which would store information about products, customers, sales, and vendors. We also wrote a simple HTML/PHP interface with Bootstrap to demonstrate the functionality. 

The website is not meant to be a complete set of functions which the coffee shop would need, but is supposed to demonstrate our understanding of SQL databases and queries. We provided nine useful functions.
